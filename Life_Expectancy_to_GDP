# Goals of This Project:
# 
# For this project, you will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.
# 
# During this project, you will analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.

# In[25]:


# First I need to import the necessary libraries I'll need
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd


# In[26]:


# Now to import the data that I'll be using and take a look at it
countries_gdp = pd.read_csv('all_data.csv')
print(countries_gdp.head())
# Column names Chile, Year, Life expectancy at birth (years), GDP
print(countries_gdp.info())
# The column types object, int, float, float (respectivly)


# **Take Aways At First Glance**
# 1) I'm going to have to convert the GDP Column into actual numbers that I can analyze (I'll do this by applying float() to each number in the column
# 
# 2) I'm going to have to create individual variables for each country holding all of their relevent information
# 
# 3) Then I'll want to plot some visualizations to see if I can spot and correlations, and take a look at the averages of Life Expectancy and average GDP.
# 
# 4) Then I want to create a single figure where I can compaire of the scatter plots side-by-side for each country.
# 
# 5) I'll also want to look at the changes in a countries GDP and see if their is a respective change in Life Expectancy

# In[27]:


# to change GDP column into a float
countries_gdp['GDP_int'] = countries_gdp['GDP'].apply(int) # to add a new column with the GDP converted to int
#print(countries_gdp.head()) # to check to make sure I did it correctly
del countries_gdp['GDP'] # to remove the old GDP column that I wont need anymore
#print(countries_gdp.head()) # to check to make sure I did it right
countries_gdp.rename(columns={'GDP_int': 'GDP'}, inplace=True) # to rename my new column back to GDP
print(countries_gdp.head()) # to check to make sure that I did it right


# In[28]:


# Now I need to create the individual variables for each country
chile_gdp = countries_gdp[countries_gdp['Country'] == 'Chile']
#print(chile_gdp.head()) # to inspect and make sure I did it correctly
china_gdp = countries_gdp[countries_gdp['Country'] == 'China']
germany_gdp = countries_gdp[countries_gdp['Country'] == 'Germany']
mexico_gdp = countries_gdp[countries_gdp['Country'] == 'Mexico']
united_states_gdp = countries_gdp[countries_gdp['Country'] == 'United States of America']
zimbabwe_gdp = countries_gdp[countries_gdp['Country'] == 'Zimbabwe']
#print(zimbabwe_gdp.head()) # to inspect it and make sure that I did it correctly


# Now that I have my data split up into individual variables by country, I want to begin to visualize some of these and see if there is a correlation.

# ## Findings
# 
# 1) Talking a look at the above six scatter plots representing Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, USA, and Zimbabwe with respect to the relationship between Life Expectancy and the countries GDP, respectivly.
# 
#     1. What we can clearly see if that there is a clear increase in life expectancy as there is an increase in each countries GDP respectivly.
#     
#     2. There are naturally outliers that don't let it coverge on a perferct inclined line, but accross countries from accross the world, this relationship holds steady.
#     
#     3. The last point to consider is that GDP is likely not the singular reason for an increase in Life Expectancy (i.e. increased Healthcare Coverage, higher Education Rates, etc).
